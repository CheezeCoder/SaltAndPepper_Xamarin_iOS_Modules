# SaltAndPepper_Xamarin_iOS_Modules
A collection of Encapsulated use cases for an iOS App using the Xamarin Platform and C#

This readme will be more comprehensive with a future update.  For now this project is meant to show how Xamarin iOS examples of typical 
iOS application design patterns are built using Xamarin.  

It is also very much a learning exploration project as I try to create each example in the most encapsulated way possible and
attempting to maintin best practice both in iOS API programming and C# programming.  

Stay Tuned and PLEASE feel free to make suggestions or improvements.  I am relitavely new to the iOS field.
